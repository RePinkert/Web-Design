Create a single-column, fixed-width web page featuring a recipe of your choice. 
You must find a recipe that allows you to complete the requirements of the assignment, plus find three or more supporting photos.

---
What you will demonstrate:
- Construction of a simple web standard web page by combining essential HTML and CSS
- Content hierarchy and block level elements (normal stacking behavior)
- Writing clean, professional code -- including commenting and indentation
- Creating links, adding in an image with caption, and the basics of web colors and design
- Basic approaches for how to style using the box model
- Validation of your code
---
Process
1. START BY CONSTRUCTING THE TEMPLATE YOURSELF - DO NOT START WITH AN ALREADY COMPLETED DEMO FROM CLASS. You can reference those examples, but don't copy and paste beyond things like the CSS utilities, as this will lead you to not really understand or remember how to do all of this on your own and make your life harder at the end of the semester. Start from scratch. Do it yourself.

2. Project folder name should look like this: P1-Your Last Name-Your First Name

3. The layout / style CAN look similar to our practice projects in class, but that is not expected. Experiment as you are able.

4. Add your images related to your recipe to a folder called images

5. Make sure you attribute content (say where you found it) the sources for the recipe and images in comments in your code.

6. Don't forget to replace any special characters indicated in class as important for typography -- for this project only, make sure at least a couple of special characters need to be used so we can see that you understand how to do this.

7. When you're done, zip your folder and turn it in on Canvas. See directions below.

Basic expectations

- VALID CODE in both your HTML file and CSS file
- Required: Basic HTML Elements:
    - Use three images or more ( at least one with the `<figure>` & `<figcaption>` tags) AT LEAST ONE IMAGE SHOULD HAVE A CAPTION
    -  Include one of each (or more) `<ul>` and `<ol>` lists
    - Add in at least one table (basic `<table><tr><td>` structure is fine)
    - Use at least two levels of headers in your HTML (for example, `<h1>` and `<h2>`)
    - One or more links `<a href=""></a>`
    - Background color required / background image good too, but optional for P1
- Take advantage of the knowledge we used in our class example:
    - such as how to set the width of and how to center a box (your "container" div)
    - how to set the background color of the page and container elements
    - how to apply basic formatting and styling to text
    - how to create a line using CSS instead of <hr>
    - when to adjust text styling to create a better typographic experience
    - floating an element to make it appear to one side or the other
    - hiding a title with the screen reader style (if needed)
